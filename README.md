# CryptoText Encryptor

**A simple cryptography project using Caesar and Vigenère ciphers.**  
Built as part of a digital forensics case study simulation.

---

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how classical encryption algorithms can be used  
to secure text messages — and how investigators might decrypt them in a forensic context.

### Features
- Caesar Cipher (Shift-based encryption)
- Vigenère Cipher (Key-based encryption)
- Plaintext and Ciphertext examples

---

## Example Output

=== Digital Forensic ===

Encrypted Evidence 1 (Caesar): RJJYNSL FY 10 UR
Encrypted Evidence 2 (Vigenere): MCOJMXMCEXX LXDL

[Decryption Process]
Decrypted Evidence 1: MEETING AT 10 PM
Decrypted Evidence 2: CONFIDENTIAL DATA

Case Conclusion:
The recovered messages show coordination timing between suspects.

## How to Run

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Run Script
```bash
python main.py
Output
You will see encrypted and decrypted messages in the terminal window.
